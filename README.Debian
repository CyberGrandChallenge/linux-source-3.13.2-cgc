 This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of the Linux kernel
 sources. An attempt has been made to keep this directory as close to
 the pristine sources as possible, modulo any patches that the Debian
 maintainer has deemed required. 

	You may treat this directory just as you would any source tree
 that you download from a primary Linux kernel archive site.

	If you wish to create a kernel image Debian package, e.g.:
 ../linux-image3.13.2-cgc_3.13.2-cgc-C1.0_i386.deb
 please read /usr/share/doc/kernel-source-3.13.2-cgc/README.gz fileand follow
 directions. 

	The file /usr/share/doc/kernel-source-3.13.2-cgc/Rationale.gz contains
 reasons why you may wish to do so.
