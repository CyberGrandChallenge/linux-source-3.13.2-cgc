This directory contains various Makefile snippets which used to be in
the variable setting part of the monolithic rules file, and then went
into local-vars.mk, and now have been pulled off into their own
section.

checks.mk: Various checks that would let the build process detect and
           abort on various error conditions.

config.mk: Various internal variable set based on defaults and the
           user configuration files, or from environment vars.

defaults.mk: This file sets default values for variables _before_ the
             user configuration files are read.

initrd.mk: This snippet uses hard coded version based heuristics to
           determine which set of tools would be viable for providing
           an initrd or initramdisk for the kernel being built, if
           initrd's are selected by the user as desired.

modules.mk: This file deals with setting up variables, looking at
            directories, and creating a list of valid third party
            modules available for the kernel being built.

pkg_names.mk: This file sets up package names for the packages we can
              build (based on kernel version), the locations under
              ./debian where these packages shall be built, and the
              corresponding relative directory paths

version_vars.mk: This file looks at the top level kernel Makefile, and
                 extracts the components of the version string. It
                 uses the kernel Makefile itself, so it takes into
                 account everything the kernel Makefile itrself pays
                 attention to.
