This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of the Linux kernel
Documentation. Linux was written by Linus Torvalds

This package was put together by Herbert Xu
<herbert@greathan.apana.org.au>, from sources retrieved from
directories under ftp.cs.helsinki.fi:/pub/Software/Linux/Kernel/v1.3

   There are various readme's in the kernel Documentation/
   subdirectory: these typically contain kernel-specific installation
   notes for some drivers for example. See
   /usr/share/doc/kernel-doc-X.X.XX/Documentation/00-INDEX for a list of
   what is contained in each file.  Please read the Changes file, as
   it contains information about the problems, which may result by
   upgrading your kernel.

 These files have been packaged separately for Debian.
