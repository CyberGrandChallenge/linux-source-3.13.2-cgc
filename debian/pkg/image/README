 This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of the Linux kernel
 binary image and modules. Linux was written by Linus Torvalds
 <torvalds@osdl.org> and others.

 The kernel sources may be retrieved from ftp.us.kernel.org:/pub/linux/kernel/

 This package contains the Linux kernel image, the System.map file,
 and the modules built by the packager.  It also contains scripts that
 try to ensure that the system is not left in a unbootable state
 after an update.
