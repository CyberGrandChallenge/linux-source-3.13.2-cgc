Description: Linux kernel source for version =V
 This package provides the source code for the Linux kernel, specifically,
 version =V.
 .
 You may configure the kernel to your setup by typing "make config"
 and following instructions, but you could get ncursesX.X-dev and try
 "make menuconfig" for a jazzier, and easier to use interface. There 
 are options to use QT or GNOME based configuration interfaces, but they
 need additional packages to be installed. Also, please read the detailed 
 documentation in the file README.headers.gz in the documentation directory
 /usr/share/doc/=ST-source-=V/.
 .
 If you wish to use this package to create a custom Linux kernel, then
 it is suggested that you investigate the package kernel-package,
 which has been designed to ease the task of creating kernel image
 packages. 

Package: =ST-image-=V=SA

Priority: optional
Provides: =ST-image,  =ST-image-=CV
Pre-Depends: debconf (>= 0.2.17) | debconf-2.0
Depends: =I coreutils (>= 5.96)
Suggests: fdutils, =ST-doc-=V=SA | =ST-source-=V, ksymoops, =ST-image-=V=SA-dbg
Description: Linux kernel binary image for version =V=SA
 This package contains the Linux kernel image for version 
 =V=SA.
 .
 It also contains the corresponding System.map file, and the modules
 built by the packager.  It also contains scripts that try to ensure
 that the system is not left in a unbootable state after an update.
 .
 Kernel image packages are generally produced using kernel-package,
 and it is suggested that you install that package if you wish to
 create a custom kernel from the sources. Please look at kernel-img.conf(5),
 and /usr/share/doc/kernel-package/README.gz  from the package kernel-package
 for details on how to tailor the  installation of this or any other kernel 
 image package

Description: Linux kernel debug image for version =V=SA 
 This package contains the Linux kernel debug image for version
  =V=SA.
 This means the debugging information for the modules in the kernel
 image package, and the uncompressed vmlinux image; it is not intended
 to be bootable. This is useful for debugging the Linux kernel.

 kernel-specific installation notes for some drivers. for
 example. Please see
 /usr/share/doc/=ST-doc-X.X.XX/Documentation/00-INDEX
 for a list of contents.  Please also read the Changes file, as it
 contains information about the problems which may result by upgrading
 your kernel.
